# AdventOfCode
The code for the different days of the Advent of Code

## Intention
My intention with this repository is to have all the challenges of the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/).
This repository can be filled with any language you want to write the challenges in. 
Once this year is done, the other years will be filled too.

## How to contribute
Make a fork of this repository. Then add your code or improvements and make a pull request. 
I will then review the pull request and accept it.
